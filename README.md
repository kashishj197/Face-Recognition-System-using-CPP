# Face-Recognition-System-using-CPP
Face Recognition system is the modern day technology, Developers working around on various new and old algorithms to achieve perfect results. This project was developed to test one of the most popular and powerful HOG algorithm in Computer Vision World by developing a face recognition system using OpenCV and Cpp. In this project core concepts are used. Therefore, any one can understand the concept of how Image Processing and HOG algorithm works to verify that the face is registered or not.
